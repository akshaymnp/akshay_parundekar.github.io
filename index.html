            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I am Dr Akshay Parundekar. I am a computational biologist experienced in machine learning based tools coupled with skills in kinetic and statistical modeling. 
              This makes me uniquely poised to provide insightful solutions and novel algorithms to address complex prediction problems. I have worked with clients such as Bial Biotech and Riche I2O in the disease areas of 
              Parkinson's disease (PD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). I have analyzed longitudinal clinical data addressing the goals like patient stratification, biomarker discovery and treatment cost mitigation.
